# SKILL CARD

| Section | Details |
|---|---|
| **Skill Name** | Social Content Sniper |
| **What gets automated** | Instead of manually researching trending content and figuring out how to reply, this skill automates the entire process. |
| **BEFORE: Manual** | **Process:** Manually scrolling X/Telegram to hunt for news (easily sucked into doom-scrolling, losing focus). After finding news, still have to "rack your brain" to figure out what angle to write from (Humor or Analysis?). **Reality:** Takes about 30–45 min/post. The problem isn't just time — it's "Mental fatigue" (Cognitive load): having to filter junk news manually and easily hitting Writer's block when the market is boring. |
| **AFTER: With Skill** | **Process:** Type 1 command → AI auto-scans & scores → Returns 3 drafts (Meme/News/Deep dive) ready to post. **Time:** 3–5 min/post (20x faster). Never miss hot news, always have multi-angle content, on-brand Voice. |
| **Tools/AI Used** | Claude, Openclaw |
| **Limitations** | 1. **Data Latency:** No Firehose API → 15–60 min delay vs real-time. English sources prioritized. 2. **Heuristic Scoring:** Rule-based scoring, doesn't learn from user feedback. Fixed engagement threshold (>100 replies). 3. **Verification Scope:** Source links provided but accuracy not verified. Scam URL filtering is pattern-based. 4. **Text-Only:** Generates text drafts only. No auto-posting, no image/video generation, no scheduling. |
| **Expansion Roadmap** | v1.0 (Current) — Core pipeline: Scan, Score, Generate. · v1.1 — Sentiment Analysis (Fear/Greed index) for output formatting. · v2.0 — ML-based scoring that learns from user feedback. |
